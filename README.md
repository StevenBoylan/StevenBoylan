## Hello world <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

My name is Steven and I currently work as an Innovation Consultant. </br>
That basically means I help clients understand what technologies like AI, XR and Web3 can do for their business. </br>
I have created, project managed and lead EU funded innovation projects for clients covering a wide range of verticals including: *SmartCities, eCommerce, MedTech, FinTech, Tourism, InsureTech, EdTech and GreenTech...* for a wide range of clients including SMEs and Large Corporations. 

I studied a Degree in Computer Science but have always worked at the intersection of technology, so basically, i'm not a professional programmer. 

At the weekends, you'll find me hurtling down a mountain on my mountain bike - *only slightly out of control* - or hunting for treasures in a local park with my 4 year old daughter. I'm passionate about good food and drink and spend way too much time thinking up new ways to cook and present interesting dishes.

### Blog posts

I write a lot professionally *(Tech docs, Start of the Art reports, Project Creation documentation etc etc)*, none of which I can share. However, when I get time, I publish on Medium about stuff that interests me *(Tech, Parenting, etc)*. </br>
If you want to check it out, here are some links:

### Languages

I am currently experimenting with the following languages, but only when I get something worth sharing, I'll add it here.

### Disclamer
*I am not a professional programmer - nor am I pretending to be one* </br>
Although I have a Degree in Computer Science, I have spent most of my carrer since University working in Marketing or Product. That means, I understand enough to be able to advise clients on how best to use technology, or how it will fit with their business model...or even, how they can create new business models using this technology. </br>
This profile is simply a space for me to experiment with code and create a few proofs of concepts that I think are interesting enough to share. </br>
If you are an experienced programmer, *I'm pretty sure there will be nothing useful for you here.* <br>
However, everyone is welcome to look and use the code here.
